# Sentiment Analysis for Product Improvement

## Introduction
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a powerful technique that can help businesses better understand their customers' opinions and preferences by analyzing the sentiment expressed towards specific aspects or features of a product or service. This project aims to leverage ABSA to identify the key features that customers are looking for and provide insights to help improve the product or service.

## Project Overview
The project consists of the following steps:

1. **Fetching Reviews and Data**: The first step is to fetch the review data from the G2 website using their API. This involves obtaining the necessary API credentials and extracting the relevant review data, including the review text, ratings, and any other metadata.

2. **Review Data Pruning**: Once the raw review data is obtained, the next step is to preprocess and clean the data. This includes converting the text to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters, and tokenizing the text. Additionally, custom stop words are removed, and the text is lemmatized to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

3. **Sentiment Analysis using LDA**: The project uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic modeling technique, to identify the dominant topics or aspects discussed in the reviews. This allows us to understand the key features that customers are talking about and the sentiment associated with each feature.

4. **Predicting Future Features using LLM**: To further enhance the analysis, the project utilizes a pre-trained language model, such as GPT-2, to generate example sentences for the identified features. This helps provide more natural and realistic suggestions for future product features that customers might be interested in.

5. **Visualizations and Insights**: The project includes a variety of visualizations to help stakeholders better understand the insights derived from the ABSA. These include:
   - Dominant Topic Distribution: A pie chart showing the distribution of dominant topics across the reviews.
   - Top Features per Topic: A bar chart displaying the number of top features (keywords) for each topic.
   - Sentiment Score Distribution: A histogram or density plot showing the distribution of sentiment scores across the reviews.
   - Sentiment Trends over Time: A line chart (if the data has a timestamp column) showing the sentiment trends over time.
   - Word Cloud: A word cloud visualization of the most frequently used words in the review text.
   - Correlation Matrix: A heatmap showing the correlation between the different topics or features extracted from the reviews.
   - Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix that shows the performance of the sentiment analysis model.
   - Topic Composition per Review: A stacked bar chart that displays the topic composition for each review.
   - Sentiment Score by Dominant Topic: A bar chart that shows the average sentiment score for each dominant topic.
   - Review Length Distribution: A histogram that visualizes the distribution of review lengths.
   - Top Features Treemap: An interactive treemap that showcases the hierarchical structure of the top features for each topic.

6. **Improvements and Recommendations**: Based on the insights gained from the ABSA, the project can provide recommendations for improving the product or service. This may include identifying new features that customers are interested in, enhancing existing features, or addressing any pain points or negative sentiments expressed in the reviews.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x installed
   - Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `wordcloud`, `transformers`
   - G2 website API credentials (for fetching review data)

2. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Obtain the necessary API credentials from the G2 website to access the review data.
   - Implement the code to fetch the review data from the G2 API and save it to a local file or database.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Implement the code to preprocess and clean the review data, including converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, tokenizing, removing stop words, and lemmatizing.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Implement the code to perform the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and extract the dominant topics and associated keywords.
   - Integrate the pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-2) to generate example sentences for the identified features.

5. **Visualization and Insights**:
   - Implement the code to generate the various visualizations, including the pie chart, bar chart, histogram, line chart, word cloud, correlation matrix, confusion matrix, and treemap.
   - Ensure the visualizations are interactive and provide meaningful insights to stakeholders.

6. **Improvements and Recommendations**:
   - Analyze the insights gained from the ABSA and the generated example sentences.
   - Provide recommendations for improving the product or service based on the identified customer needs and preferences.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Package the code and visualizations into a Streamlit application for easy deployment and sharing with stakeholders.
   - Consider hosting the Streamlit application on a cloud platform for wider accessibility.

By following these steps, you can implement the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis project and provide valuable insights to help improve your product or service based on customer feedback.

## Conclusion
This Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis project leverages advanced natural language processing techniques and pre-trained language models to extract valuable insights from customer reviews. By identifying the key features and aspects that customers are interested in, as well as the sentiment associated with them, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance their products or services and better meet the needs of their customers.

The project's comprehensive approach, including data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and interactive visualizations, provides a powerful tool for stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of their customer base and make data-driven improvements to their offerings.
